EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - CONTRACT RISK ANALYSIS
Generated by NyayaAI
================================================================================

OVERALL RISK SCORE: 100/100

⚠️  HIGH RISK - Significant concerns identified. Careful review recommended.

SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This contract presents a **High Risk** to our business, primarily due to extremely restrictive confidentiality terms and potentially costly legal dispute clauses. The overall assessment indicates significant exposure, with a majority of the critical clauses posing high risks.

The main concerns revolve around intellectual property ownership and the financial implications of legal disputes. The confidentiality clauses are unusually broad and could severely limit our ability to innovate or use our own developments if they are even tangentially related to the other party's confidential information. While confidentiality and jurisdiction clauses are standard in contracts, the specific wording here, especially regarding ownership of 'derivatives' and the 'prevailing party' legal fees, is unusually aggressive and heavily favors the other party.

In practical terms, this could stifle our innovation, create significant legal liabilities, and make any future disagreements extremely expensive, even if we believe we have a strong case. It's crucial to address these points before signing to protect our business interests and future growth.


TOP RISKS TO CONSIDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Confidentiality (Clause: clause_9)
   This clause states that *any* information we create, even if it's just *derived* from the other party's confidential information, will belong to them. This means if we use their information to develop new products, processes, or ideas, they could claim ownership of our innovations. This is a major threat to our intellectual property and future business development, potentially giving them rights to our own R&D.

2. Confidentiality (Clause: clause_2)
   The incomplete nature of this clause, combined with the overall high risk, suggests that the exceptions or limitations to our confidentiality obligations might be unclear or too narrow. This could lead to unintended breaches or disputes over what information we can or cannot use, creating uncertainty about our operational freedom.

3. Jurisdiction / Legal Fees (Clause: clause_10)
   This clause makes us responsible for the other party's legal fees if we lose any dispute related to this contract. This significantly increases the financial risk of any disagreement, making even minor disputes potentially very costly and raising the stakes for any litigation.


RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Negotiate Confidentiality Ownership (Clause 9):** Strongly push to modify clause 9. We need clear language that ensures we retain ownership of any intellectual property we develop independently or that is merely *inspired* by, but not directly *derived* from, their confidential information. We should only agree to return or destroy their specific confidential information, not our own developments.
2. **Clarify Confidentiality Scope and Exceptions (Clause 2):** Request a complete and clear definition of 'Confidential and Proprietary Information' and ensure that any exceptions (e.g., information already known to us, publicly available, or independently developed) are explicitly stated and broad enough to protect our operations.
3. **Review 'Prevailing Party' Fees (Clause 10):** Consider striking this clause or modifying it so that each party bears its own legal costs, regardless of the outcome. Alternatively, limit the types of disputes for which this applies or cap the recoverable fees to reduce financial exposure.
4. **Define 'Derivatives':** Ensure the contract clearly defines what constitutes a 'derivative' to avoid ambiguity and potential claims on our independent work. This definition should be narrow and specific to prevent overreach.
