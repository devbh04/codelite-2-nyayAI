EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - CONTRACT RISK ANALYSIS
Generated by NyayaAI
================================================================================

OVERALL RISK SCORE: 100/100

⚠️  HIGH RISK - Significant concerns identified. Careful review recommended.

SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This contract presents a **High Risk** profile for your business. The primary concerns revolve around intellectual property ownership, potential for unlimited legal costs, and a lack of clear exit strategy from the agreement.

While clauses covering confidentiality and dispute resolution are standard in most contracts, the specific wording in this document is heavily skewed and unusually unfavorable. It could lead to significant financial exposure and loss of control over your own innovations.

Key business impacts include the potential loss of ownership over new products or ideas you develop, a deterrent to defending your rights due to prohibitive legal fees, and the risk of being locked into an unfavorable agreement indefinitely.


TOP RISKS TO CONSIDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Confidentiality (Clause: clause_9)
   This clause states that any new ideas, products, or improvements you create, even if developed internally using shared confidential information, could become the property of the other party. This could severely limit your ability to innovate and own your intellectual property.

2. Jurisdiction (Clause: clause_10)
   If there's a legal dispute and you don't win, you could be forced to pay not only your own legal fees but also all of the other party's legal fees. This creates a huge financial risk and could make it too expensive to defend your position, even if you believe you are in the right.

3. Confidentiality (Clause: clause_2)
   The wording suggests there might be specific exceptions or loopholes that could allow the other party to legally disclose your confidential business information under certain conditions. This puts your trade secrets and competitive advantage at risk.

4. Termination (Clause: clause_6)
   The contract appears to be open-ended with no clear end date or easy way to terminate the agreement. This means you could be locked into the contract indefinitely, even if the business relationship sours or is no longer beneficial for your company.


RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Negotiate Clause 9 (IP Ownership):** Propose language that clearly states you retain ownership of any new intellectual property you develop, even if it builds upon shared confidential information. Consider a license back to the disclosing party if their information is integral.
2. **Amend Clause 10 (Legal Fees):** Remove the 'prevailing party' attorney fee provision. Alternatively, cap the amount of recoverable legal fees to reduce your financial exposure in case of a dispute.
3. **Clarify Clause 2 (Confidentiality Exceptions):** Request a clear and narrow definition of any exceptions to confidentiality to ensure your proprietary information remains fully protected and cannot be easily disclosed.
4. **Add Termination Rights to Clause 6:** Insert specific conditions for termination, including the ability to terminate 'for convenience' with reasonable notice (e.g., 60 or 90 days), and clear 'for cause' termination rights.
