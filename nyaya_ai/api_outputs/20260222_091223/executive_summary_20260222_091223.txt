OVERALL RISK SCORE: 32/100

✓ LOW RISK - Generally balanced contract with minor concerns.

SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This contract presents a generally low to moderate risk profile, with an overall risk score of 32 out of 100. Most of the clauses are considered low risk, indicating a relatively standard agreement.

The primary areas of concern, however, revolve around the handling of confidential information and potential financial exposure in legal disputes. Specifically, there are high-risk clauses that could impact our ability to own new ideas developed from shared information and expose us to significant legal costs if a disagreement escalates.

From a business perspective, we need to ensure our sensitive data is adequately protected, our innovation efforts are not unfairly restricted, and we understand the financial implications of potential legal battles before signing.


TOP RISKS TO CONSIDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Confidentiality (Clause: clause_9)
   This clause states that all confidential information, and any new ideas or improvements (called 'derivatives') created from it, remain the property of the disclosing party. This is a critical risk because if we use their confidential information to develop new products, services, or internal processes, the contract might prevent us from owning or independently using those new developments. This could severely limit our innovation, future business opportunities, and intellectual property growth.

2. Confidentiality (Clause: clause_2)
   While the full text is cut off, this clause mentions 'exceptions' to confidentiality. This means there might be specific situations or conditions under which our sensitive information could be legally disclosed to others, even if we consider it highly confidential. We need to fully understand these exceptions to prevent unintended leaks of critical business data, trade secrets, or client information.

3. Jurisdiction (Clause: clause_10)
   This clause indicates that if there's a legal dispute, the 'prevailing party' (the one who wins) will be entitled to recover their attorney's fees. This means if we lose a lawsuit, we could be forced to pay not only our own legal costs but also the other party's, which can be substantial and unpredictable. This significantly increases our financial exposure in the event of a disagreement.


RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Clarify Ownership of Derivatives (Clause 9):** Negotiate terms that clearly define who owns any new intellectual property or improvements developed using the shared confidential information. Ensure our ability to innovate and commercialize our own creations is protected, perhaps through joint ownership, licenses, or clear carve-outs for our pre-existing IP.
2. **Review Confidentiality Exceptions (Clause 2):** Request the full text of clause 2 and thoroughly examine the mentioned exceptions to understand exactly when and how our confidential information can be disclosed. Seek to narrow these exceptions where possible to protect our most sensitive data and ensure they align with our business practices.
3. **Assess 'Prevailing Party' Clause (Clause 10):** Discuss the implications of the 'prevailing party' clause with legal counsel. Consider proposing that each party bears its own legal costs regardless of the outcome, or negotiate a cap on recoverable attorney's fees to limit financial exposure in case of a dispute.
4. **Define Confidential Information:** Ensure the definition of 'Confidential and Proprietary Information' is clear, specific, and mutually agreed upon to avoid future disputes over what information is protected.
