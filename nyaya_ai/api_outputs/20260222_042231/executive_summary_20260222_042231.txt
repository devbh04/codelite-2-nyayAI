OVERALL RISK SCORE: 34/100

✓ LOW RISK - Generally balanced contract with minor concerns.

SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This contract presents a Moderate Risk profile. While the overall risk score is relatively low at 34 out of 100, there are several critical clauses, particularly concerning confidentiality and legal costs, that require immediate attention. These high-risk areas could have significant business impacts if not addressed.

The primary concerns revolve around the protection and ownership of intellectual property, especially new ideas or products developed using shared confidential information. The contract's current wording could lead to the loss of ownership over innovations your team creates. Additionally, the clause regarding legal fees in a dispute could expose your company to unexpectedly high costs.

Confidentiality clauses are standard in business agreements, but the specific language here, particularly concerning 'derivatives' (new creations), is unusual and highly unfavorable. The legal fees clause, while common, is structured in a way that creates a high-stakes financial risk. Addressing these points is crucial to protect your company's assets and financial stability.


TOP RISKS TO CONSIDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Confidentiality (Clause: clause_9)
   This is a major concern for your intellectual property. The contract states that any new ideas, products, or improvements ('derivatives') created using the shared confidential information will belong to the other party, even if your team develops them. This could mean you lose ownership of your own innovations, severely impacting your future business value and competitive edge.

2. Confidentiality (Clause: clause_2)
   This clause has an exception that might allow the other party to disclose your confidential information under certain conditions. This could expose sensitive business data, trade secrets, or client lists to competitors or the public, potentially harming your reputation and competitive advantage.

3. Jurisdiction (Clause: clause_10)
   This clause states that the 'prevailing party' (the one who wins) in a legal dispute gets their attorney fees paid by the loser. While seemingly fair, this creates a high financial risk. If you lose, even a minor dispute, you could be responsible for both your own legal fees and the other party's, leading to significantly higher and unpredictable costs.


RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Negotiate Clause 9 (Confidentiality - Derivatives):** Strongly push to revise this clause. Insist on language that clearly states your company retains ownership of any new intellectual property or 'derivatives' developed by your team, even if it builds upon shared confidential information. Consider a framework for joint ownership or licensing if co-creation is intended.
2. **Clarify Clause 2 (Confidentiality - Exceptions):** Seek to narrow down and clearly define any exceptions to confidentiality. Ensure that your sensitive information is protected from disclosure unless explicitly agreed upon or legally mandated, and that you have control over such disclosures.
3. **Amend Clause 10 (Jurisdiction - Attorney Fees):** Consider removing the 'prevailing party' attorney fees clause. A common and more predictable alternative is for each party to bear its own legal costs, regardless of the outcome. If it must remain, ensure there's a clear and fair definition of what constitutes a 'prevailing party'.
4. **Review Clause 1 (Confidentiality Definition):** Ensure the definition of 'Confidential and Proprietary Information' is comprehensive and clearly protects all relevant business assets, including trade secrets, customer data, and strategic plans.
