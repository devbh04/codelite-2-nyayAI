OVERALL RISK SCORE: 100/100

⚠️  HIGH RISK - Significant concerns identified. Careful review recommended.

SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This contract presents a **High Risk** to our business operations. The primary concerns revolve around the protection of our confidential information and the potential for costly and ambiguous legal disputes. While clauses covering confidentiality and legal jurisdiction are standard in most agreements, the specific wording in this contract is highly unusual and creates significant liabilities.

The most critical issue is the broad scope of the confidentiality clause, which could inadvertently grant us ownership over the other party's independent innovations, or vice versa, leading to immediate conflict. Additionally, the legal dispute clause is structured in a way that could encourage expensive litigation without clearly defining the rules of engagement. These issues could severely impact our intellectual property strategy, expose us to unpredictable legal costs, and make it difficult to manage or exit the relationship cleanly.


TOP RISKS TO CONSIDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Confidentiality (Clause: clause_9)
   This clause is extremely broad and states that any improvements or new ideas (derivatives) created by *either* party using our confidential information would automatically become *our* property. This is highly unusual and could prevent the other party from developing their own products or services, leading to disputes or making the contract unworkable. It also implies that *their* derivatives of *our* information might also become ours, which is likely not their intention and could cause significant conflict.

2. Jurisdiction (Clause: clause_10)
   This clause states that if either party hires lawyers to enforce their rights, the 'prevailing party' gets their legal fees covered. While this sounds fair, it can encourage litigation and make it very expensive to defend ourselves even if we have a strong case, as the definition of 'prevailing party' can be ambiguous and lead to prolonged legal battles over costs. Crucially, it also doesn't specify *which* jurisdiction's laws will apply, which is a major gap and could force us into an unfavorable court system.

3. Confidentiality (Clause: clause_2)
   This clause is vague about the exceptions to confidentiality, referring to an unprovided 'Paragraph 3 below'. This makes it unclear when and how confidential information *can* be disclosed without breaching the agreement. This ambiguity could lead to unintended breaches or disputes over what information is protected, creating uncertainty for both parties.

4. Termination (Clause: clause_6)
   The termination clause only states the agreement 'will remain in effect' without specifying clear conditions for ending it. This means the contract could be perpetual or very difficult to exit, potentially trapping us in an unfavorable arrangement without clear off-ramps or exit strategies, even if the business relationship sours.


RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Redraft Confidentiality (clause 9):** Clarify ownership of 'derivatives.' We need to ensure that any improvements made by the other party using our confidential information remain their property, provided our original confidential information is protected. We must explicitly state that only *our* confidential information remains ours, not their independent creations.
2. **Amend Jurisdiction (clause 10):** Insist on specifying a clear governing law and jurisdiction (e.g., 'Laws of Delaware, USA, and courts in Wilmington, Delaware'). Also, consider removing or capping the 'prevailing party' attorney's fees provision, as it can unnecessarily escalate legal costs.
3. **Clarify Confidentiality Exceptions (clause 2):** Request the full text of 'Paragraph 3' or, better, incorporate the specific circumstances under which confidential information can be disclosed (e.g., by law, to professional advisors, with prior written consent) directly into clause 2.
4. **Add Clear Termination Rights (clause 6):** Introduce specific termination rights for both parties, including options for convenience (with reasonable notice), for material breach, and upon a change of control. This ensures we have a clear and predictable exit strategy.
